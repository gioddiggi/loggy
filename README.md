# loggy

> A tiny logger written in Rust for learning purposes.

`loggy` is a simple logging library built to understand how logging works under the hood in Rust.  
It’s intentionally small, opinionated, and easy to read.

This is **not** meant to replace production-grade logging crates like `log` or `tracing`.  
It’s a playground for learning and experimentation.
